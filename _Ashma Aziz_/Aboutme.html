<p> Hey, what's up, hello! My name is Ashma Aziz. I am the lover of arts, books and nature. I am currently a student in Queens College studying Graphic Design. I'm planning on being a book designer, since I do love books. I also love art as stated, but as in the history aspect of of it. You can always find me reading, if need to look for me.</p>
